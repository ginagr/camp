				Our amazing Camp It Up! staff includes a year-round administrative team (Web site, Marketing,
				Registration) and our program staff. We have an administration team that coordinates the registration
				process prior to camp (a humungous task!) and they keep us all organized at camp.
				<br>
				In addition to our administrative staff, our incredible program staff, which now number approximately 60
				each summer session, has been an integral part of the camper community. We estimate that some 250 staff
				members have shared their talents with us over the years. Our very popular Counselor-in-Training (CIT)
				program is run for approximately 10 teenagers each summer. Most of our staff goes through the counseling
				development cycle which includes starting as a CIT, becoming a Junior Counselor and then a Senior
				Counselor or Specialist. Some have gone on to administrative positions at Camp It Up! and now help to
				direct the camp. Some have built careers working with children, inspired by their Camp It Up!
				experience. As many of “our kids” go off to college (many returning each year to work as staff), they
				write in their college essays that Camp It Up! is the one thing that has most shaped their view of
				family and community.

				Founder

			<p>
				Jill Rose, the co-founder of Camp It Up!, has been working in various camp settings since age thirteen.
				As a Counselor, Music Specialist, Program Director, Director, Staff Trainer and Consultant, she has
				become familiar with every aspect of camp management (though she still can’t snake a toilet). She
				co-founded Camp It Up! thirty years ago and has been the camp’s director since that time. She’s a
				co-founder of Camps In Common, a non-profit corporation that manages Feather River Camp for the City of
				Oakland, California.
				<br>
				Her work with Camp It Up! is both a culmination and manifestation of her commitment to non-urban camps
				as a source for individual, familial and communal healing and empowerment. As director of Camp It Up!,
				Ms. Rose was able to experience the thrill and gratification of knowing that it is possible to make real
				and positive changes in people’s lives. Whether it has been training teenagers to work with young
				children, enabling an individual to attend and enjoy a week’s camping experience with his or her family
				for the first time, or encouraging a staff member to take on a new and challenging role, her work has
				been a source of challenge and healing, and has compelled her to continue reaching out for other
				opportunities that “make a difference.” As a Music teacher in an Oakland public school, songwriter,
				community organizer and event producer, Jill has been fortunate to find many such opportunities in her
				life. Jill retired in December 2016 from being Director of Camp It Up. She now gets to experience Camp
				It Up from the perspective of a camper.
				<br>
				Ms. Rose has been a Bay Area resident since 1967 and lives in Oakland, California. When time and money
				allow, she loves to travel; and when only time is available, she can be found playing piano and singing
				with friends, spending time with her family or playing a decidedly uncompetitive game of Scrabble.
