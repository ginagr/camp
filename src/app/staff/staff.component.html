        Our amazing Camp It Up! staff includes a year-round administrative team (Web site, Marketing,
        Registration) and our program staff. We have an administration team that coordinates the registration
        process prior to camp (a humungous task!) and they keep us all organized at camp.
        <br><br>
        In addition to our administrative staff, our incredible program staff, which now number approximately 60
        each summer session, has been an integral part of the camper community. We estimate that some 250 staff
        members have shared their talents with us over the years. Our very popular Counselor-in-Training (CIT)
        program is run for approximately 10 teenagers each summer. Most of our staff goes through the counseling
        development cycle which includes starting as a CIT, becoming a Junior Counselor and then a Senior
        Counselor or Specialist. Some have gone on to administrative positions at Camp It Up! and now help to
        direct the camp. Some have built careers working with children, inspired by their Camp It Up!
        experience. As many of “our kids” go off to college (many returning each year to work as staff), they
        write in their college essays that Camp It Up! is the one thing that has most shaped their view of
        family and community.

        Jill Rose, the co-founder of Camp It Up!, has been working in various camp settings since age thirteen. As a
        Counselor, Music Specialist, Program Director, Director, Staff Trainer and Consultant, she has become familiar
        with every aspect of camp management. She co-founded Camp It Up! over thirty years ago with Ellie Schindelman.
        She’s a co-founder of Camps In Common, a non-profit corporation that manages Feather River Camp for the City of
        Oakland, California.
        <br><br>
        Her work with Camp It Up! is both a culmination and manifestation of her commitment to non-urban camps as a
        source for individual, familial and communal healing and empowerment. As director of Camp It Up!, Ms. Rose was
        able to experience the thrill and gratification of knowing that it is possible to make real and positive changes
        in people’s lives. Whether it has been training teenagers to work with young children, enabling individual to
        attend and enjoy a week’s camping experience with their families for the first time, or encouraging a staff
        member to take on a new and challenging role, her work has been a source of challenge and healing, and has
        compelled her to continue reaching out for other opportunities that “make a difference.” As a former Oakland
        public school music teacher, songwriter, community organizer and event producer, Jill has been fortunate to find
        many such opportunities in her life. Jill retired in December 2016 from being Director of Camp It Up!
        <br><br>
        Ms. Rose has been a Northern California resident since 1967. She loves to travel and, she can be found playing
        piano and singing with friends, spending time with her family or playing a decidedly uncompetitive game of
        Scrabble.
