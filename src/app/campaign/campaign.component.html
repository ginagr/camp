		<span class="italics">Camp It Up!</span> is at a unique point in our twenty-seven year history. Our founder and past director, Jill Rose, retired at the end of 2016. Our Board of Directors has taken steps to ensure that <span class="italics">Camp It Up!</span> remains a fixture in the LGBTQ community by developing a three-year fundraising plan to transition <span class="italics">Camp It Up!</span> into a financially sustainable non-profit organization.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our <span class="italics">Camp It Up!</span> CAMPaign goal was to raise $130,000 from 2014 through 2017 to successfully accomplish the transition, and to position <span class="italics">Camp It Up!</span> to thrive in the decades to come. We launched our campaign at summer camp 2015 and continued it through the year and at camp again this summer 2016. To date we have raised close to $97,000! If we can reach our goal by the end of 2016 we will be poised to expand the reach of this vital camp to many more who need to experience it.
