        Camp It Up! supports and promotes a constellation of programs, including social, camping, performing and visual
        art, with particular outreach to LGBTQ+ individuals and families, developed to create and sustain a community
        that supports each unique family and all family members.
        <br><br>
        Camp It Up! held its first summer camp in August, 1990 at Berkeley Tuolomne Camp and approximately 130 adults
        and children attended. It was a spectacular week; campers, feeling like pioneers, shared an excitement that was
        palpable throughout the camp session.
        <br><br>
        In the thirty years since our inception, Camp It Up! has served more than 3,000 campers and 500 families. Our
        campers are a wonderful mix: lesbian, gay, transgender, single-parent, adoptive, multi-racial and heterosexual
        families, as well as adults without children. We are proud of our eclectic community and are especially proud to
        have been the first family camp in the country to do particular outreach to the LGBTQ+ community.
        <br><br>
        We moved to Feather River Camp in Quincy, California in 2000 and though Tuolomne had been our “home,” we were
        glad to move to a larger camp site so that we could accommodate even more camper families.
        <br><br>
        Over the years, we have seen a generation of children grow from babies to college students to graduates building
        their careers. Our community has celebrated many births, adoptions, commitment ceremonies, weddings, career
        changes, retirements and other life rituals. Sharing the joys and losses in our lives are the ties that bind us
        together as we grow.
        <br><br>
        In 2014, we celebrated our 25th year of camp and, in 2015, we had our first annual Drag Ball (it was
        spectacular!).
        <br><br>
        In anticipation of our eventual transition from small business to non-profit, in 2009 we established the
        non-profit organization, Camp It Up Inc. Our 501C3 status became official in August 2015 and in January of 2016,
        Camp It Up Inc. became the official owners and operators of the camp. We look back on our history with pride and
        look forward to a long and exciting future.
